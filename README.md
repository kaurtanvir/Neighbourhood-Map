# Neighbourhood Map
It is a single page application featuring map of my favourite parks in Sunnyvale. 
# Features

1. Uses Knockout JS framework to handle the list, filter, and any other information on the page that is subject to changing state.
2. Uses Google Maps API to display the map of the neighbourhood.
3. Uses FourSquare Api to display the ratings and no of likes about the locations.

## Running the App
Open index.html in your browser and click on the list of locations or the markers on map to see the likes and ratings of that place.
